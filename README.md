# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

I wanted to complete the prework study guide website to store my notes from the prework and get suggestions for what topics to focus on for study. I built this project to make returning to the information from the prework more easily. This site keeps the different topics in distinct, easy-to-read sections that makes reviewing what I've learned so far easier. Through working on this project, I've learned more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, giving me a solid starting point while entering into the bootcamp.

## Usage

To use this guide, notes for each of the four major topics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript have been broken down into sections, which you can review. By accessing the console, you can receive a suggestion on what topic to study first. To access the console, open the Chrome DevTools. For MacOS, this can be done by pressing Command+Option+I. For Windows, press Control+Shift+I. The console will list the topics and then give a randomly chosen recommendation for which topic to focus on.
