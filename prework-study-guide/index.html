          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
            <li>The metadata contained in the head element is not visible on the webpage.</li>
            <li>The !DOCTYPE element tells the browser what type of document it should expect. !DOCTYPE html tells the webpage to expect an HTML document.</li>
            <li>The html element represents the start and end of our document.The opening tag defines the language the browser will use. For example, the opening tag for an english browser would read html lang=en.</li>
            <li>The title element defines the title for the webpage.</li>
            <li>The style element defines associated CSS styles.</li>
            <li>The base element defines the webpage's base URL, and the link element connects an external resource.</li>
            <li>The meta element defines metadata, such as the available character set.</li>
            <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>The id attribute is used as a way to identify and select elements.</li>
            <li>The ul element creates an unordered list, like this one! The ol element creates a numbered list.</li>
            <li>For hyperlinks, the a element is used to create a linke, and the href attribute points to the URL.</li>
            <li>The img element is used to add images. The src attribute points to the location of the image, alt is a string of text that describes the image, and you can set the width and height.</li>
            <li>The p element represents a block of text.</li>
            <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent different levels of headings. The h1 element is the largest heading, and h6 is the smallest.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is applied to a specifice HTML tag, making them useful for quick and permanent changes but are a lot less flexible than style sheets.</li>
          <li>An internal CSS style sheet is embedded into the document with the style element inside the head element. The CSS rules will only apply to this webpage.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheets are the ones most commonly used as they allow us to keep the rules in their own file, making it easier to make design changes.</li>
          <li>You use the link element in the head element to link an external style sheet. Ex. link rel="stylesheet" href = "./assets/style.css", where rel defines the relationship and href points to the external sheet.</li>
          <li>Using the * selector means that the rule will apply to every page element.</li>
          <li>You can group together two or more elements as selectors if they are going to share the same styling. Ex. header, footer</li>
          <li>CSS rules are structured as follows: selector {property1: value1; property2: value2; ...}</li>
          <li>We can use class attributes to share a CSS rule to any element of our choosing by assigning the rule to an attribute with a selector.</li>
          <li>You assign the class attribute to the element in HTML. Ex. section class="selector" id="section-id".</li>
          <li>Class selectors will have a period in front of them when defining rules in the style sheet. Ex. .card.</li>
          <li>When setting a value for the color property, you can use either a semantic reference such as gray or blue, or by using its hexadecimal code.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks the current brance that we are on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branchname: creates a new branch with the specified name and moves to it.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: merges commits from the main branch into the current branch.</li>
          <li>git add -A: commits all files in the working branch.
          <li>git commit -m "message": makes a commit, -m flag associates a message with our commit.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>Functions are blocks of code that are not run unless called, making them reusable.</li>
            <li>Arrays store multiple values at a time.</li>
            <li>Arrays are zero indexed, which means that the first index of the array is always 0.</li>
            <li>For loops allow a code block to be executed repeatedly.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is weakly typed, meaning it allows type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types.</li>
            <li>Primitive types aside from null and undefined have built in methods you can use, such as toExponential() for the Number object.</li>
